## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<img width="550" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-16 at 2 16 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77817870/118412909-69e2a780-b651-11eb-8ebb-b202cacb2eba.png">

The coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD. 

The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. We can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

Yes, this linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of all predictions for mpg of MechaCar prototypes will be correct when using this linear model.

The variance for all manufacturing lots in total is 62.30, which does not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The variance for manufacturing lot 1 is 0.98, and the variance for manufacturing lot 2 is 7.47, which are both well below 100 pounds per square inch. The variance for manufacturing lot 3 is 170.29, which exceeds 100 pounds per square inch.
